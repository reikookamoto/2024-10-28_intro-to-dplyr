# 2024-10-28_intro-to-dplyr

Workshop with Health AI and Data Science Journal Club at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute

## Overview

In this workshop, participants will learn how to manipulate data efficiently using key functions from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package. We'll cover how to select specific columns, filter rows based on conditions, create new variables, and summarize data.

This hands-on session is designed to help you work with data in a tidy, structured way, enabling faster and more intuitive data analysis.

## Intended Audience

This workshop is designed for:

-   Beginner programmers who are new to R;

-   Individuals experienced in other programming languages who want to learn R; and

-   Base R users interested in transitioning to the tidyverse.

Ideally, participants should have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, data structures, and functions.
